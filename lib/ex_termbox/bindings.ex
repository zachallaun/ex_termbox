defmodule ExTermbox.Bindings do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides the low-level bindings to the termbox library. This module loads the
  NIFs defined in `c_src/` and thinly wraps the C interface.

  For event-handling, it's recommended to use the `ExTermbox.EventManager` API
  instead of the raw interface exposed here.

  For more complex applications, it's recommended to use the high-level
  rendering API provided by Ratatouille (a terminal UI kit based on the bindings
  here). Ratatouille manages things like initialization, updates and shutdown
  automatically, and provides a declarative, HTML-like interface for rendering
  content to the screen. See the repo for details:

  <https://github.com/ndreynolds/ratatouille>

  See also the termbox header file for additional documentation of the functions
  here:

  <https://github.com/nsf/termbox/blob/master/src/termbox.h>

  Note that the "NIF <function>/<arity> not loaded" messages below are fallbacks
  normally replaced by the natively-implemented functions at load. If you're
  seeing this message, it means the native bindings could not be loaded. Please
  open an issue with the error and relevant system information.

  ### Event Polling

  The event polling API differs slightly from the termbox API in order to make
  it in the Erlang ecosystem. Instead of blocking poll calls, it uses
  asynchronous message passing to deliver events to the caller.

  It's recommended to use the `ExTermbox.EventManager` gen_server to subscribe
  to terminal events instead of using these bindings directly. It supports
  multiple subscriptions and more gracefully handles errors.

  #### Implementation Notes

  In the `start_polling/1` NIF, an OS-level thread is created which performs the
  blocking event polling (i.e., a `select` call). This allows the NIF to return
  quickly and avoid causing the scheduler too much trouble. It would be very bad
  to block the scheduler thread until an event is received.

  While using threads solves this problem, it unfortunately also introduces new
  ones. The bindings implement some locking mechanisms to try to coordinate
  threading logic and prevent polling from occurring simultaneously, but this
  sort of logic is hard to get right (one of the reasons we use Elixir/Erlang).
  No issues are currently known, but please report any you happen to encounter.

  #### Timeouts

  You might have noticed that there's no binding for `tb_peek_event` (which
  accepts a timeout). That's because it's easy enough to implement a timeout
  ourselves with `start_polling/1` and `receive` with `after`, e.g.:

      {:ok, _resource} = Bindings.start_polling(self())

      receive do
        {:event, event} ->
          # handle the event...
      after
        1_000 ->
          :ok = Bindings.stop_polling(self())
          # do something else...
      end
